												<h2>Prototype 1</h2>
											</header>
											<p>This prototype was the first playable prototype we designed to demonstrate the core tower defense concept we envisioned for the final 
												product. Contrary to other tower defense games, there exists a player character that can be controlled to attack enemies. The player 
												is seen as a blue/red circle w/ an option for co-op gameplay in the main menu. The map is formed using simple square plots to 
												differentiate the path from the background. Waves of enemies gradually work their way (via one path) toward the main tower, a 
												structure intended for players to protect. The main gameplay functions are not included such as healthbars, a game-over state, 
												defense placement.</p>

												<h2>Alpha</h2>
											</header>
											<p>The second iteration of our game was not uploaded correctly due to technical issues shortly before playtesting took place, so 
												any feedback would be on an earlier version that does not reflect the latest build. However, we were still able to gather ideas 
												for player control. The build includes game over states for player death and when the main tower is destroyed, player & tower 
												healthbars. New enemy types were added as well, but they have not been implemented correctly and are invincible.</p>

												<h2>Beta</h2>
											</header>
											<p>The alpha prototype is the third iteration of our game. The game has been fleshed out to include player auto-targeting to 
												essentially guarantee that player projectiles will hit enemies. There is now an XP bar and more enemy types that spawn at 
												higher waves. The map layout was changed to fit the theme of the game (fantasy) and look better than previous builds that 
												had a half-baked look to them. Holding the fire key will now auto-fire player attack, map now has a boundary, and enemies 
												now follow random paths, spawning at random start points to prevent camping.</p>

										<h2>Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The most common feedback we received from all the playtests was the control scheme. It seems like it was hard for new players to 
										get used to 2-player keyboard controls, or figure out how to actually play the game, so focus should be pivoted to make controls 
										more obvious, offering a tutorial level/screen to ease the transition for newer players.</p>
